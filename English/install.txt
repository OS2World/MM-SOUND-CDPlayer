    Installation
    ============

    For installation, you can use the rexx script 'INSTALL.CMD'.
    The file must be in the same directory as the other files
    of the CD player. Start 'INSTALL' with name of the target
    directory as argument, for example:

    INSTALL C:\CDPLAYER

    All necessary files for using the CD player and the documentation 
    are copied to this directory. In addition, two objects are
    created on your workplace shell:
 
    "The CD Player" -
        to start the CD Player

    "CD Player Documentation" -
        to read the documentation of the CD Player

    You can move this objects to any folder you like.

    NOTE!

    If you are a registered user of the CD Player, please use your 
    previous directory as the target directory. Your CD library will
    not become overwritten, and the new version will become automatically
    registered.

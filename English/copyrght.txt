    Shareware
    =========

    Writing this program has taken lots of work. If you continue
    using it after a reasonable trial period of 30 days, you have
    to pay a small fee to the author.
                                                                
    SHAREWARE is NOT FREE SOFTWARE. You can, however, test shareware
    before purchasing it.
    
    You are encouraged to copy and pass on the unregistered shareware
    version of this program, if
    - the program is distributed in its original form
      (complete, unmodified, uninstalled)
    - the distribution fee does not exceed the equivalent of DM 15.-.


    Registration
    ============

    If you want to continue using the CD Player after 30 days, you have to
    register.

    The registrated version contains no shareware reference. There are no
    other limitations in the shareware version.

    See "REGISTER.TXT" for the registration fee valid for your
    country (DM 30.- to DM 50.- depending on the country).

    Upgrades
    ========

    If the user has a modem, upgrades are free. Other registered users
    only have to pay the fee of their shareware vendor (usually DM 5).

    However, upgrades will cost DM 10 to DM 20, if there are major 
    enhancements to the program.
